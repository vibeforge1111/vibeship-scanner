This happens if the proposal is created using explicit function signatures, e.g. a proposal to invoke the function `foo(uint256)` is created as `propose([target], [0], [\"foo(uint256)\"], [\"0x00..01\"])`. If the function selector is provided as part of the encoded proposal data the issue is not present, e.g. the same proposal is created as `propose([target], [0], [\"0x2fbebd3800..01\"])`, where `2fbebd38` is the function selector.\n\nWe've assessed the instances of this contract found on chain, and did not find any occurrence of this bug in the past. Proposal creation through Tally or OpenZeppelin Defender is not affected. The core `Governor` contract on its own is not affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix is included in version v4.4.2 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not create proposals using explicit function signatures. Instead, use the `propose` function without the `signatures` argument, and create the proposal using the fully ABI-encoded function call including the function selector in the `calldatas` argument as explained above.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/3099\n\n### Credits\n\nThis issue was identified and reported by @GeraldHost.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or need assistance regarding this advisory, email us at security@openzeppelin.com.\n\nTo submit security reports please use [our bug bounty on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/openzeppelin/)."}, {"id": "CVE-2023-30542", "fix": {"template": "Update @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable to 4.8.3", "available": true}, "title": "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable: GovernorCompatibilityBravo may trim proposal calldata", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2023-30542", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/contracts/pnpm-lock.yaml", "line": 0}, "severity": "high", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/8d633cb7d169f2f8595b273660b00b69e845c2fe", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.8.3"], "description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development.

This issue was resolved by aligning the max size between the data types in the cosmossdk.io/math package.\n\nThis issue impacts consumers of the cosmossdk.io/math, which includes popular modules including IBC-Go and tokenfactory (permissionless). If your chain interacts with APIs in the cosmossdk.io/math package, or utilizes a module that consumes this library, it is advised to update to the latest version at the time of the patch release by updating your project's go.mod dependency for cosmossdk.io/math.\n\nThe patch can be applied without a hard-fork, and with a version bump in a chain's go.mod file like the following:\n\n#### `go.mod`\n\n```diff\n- cosmossdk.io/math v1.3.0\n+ cosmossdk.io/math v1.4.0\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> When on a lower version than cosmossdk.io/math v1.3.0, please do a coordinated upgrade before upgrading to >= 1.3.0\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new release of `cosmossdk.io/math v1.4.0` resolves this issue.  Chains that utilize the cosmossdk.io/math library or modules that utilize the cosmossdk.io/math library should update to avoid this condition.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* October 31, 2024, 6:55pm UTC: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* October 31, 2024, 8:56pm UTC: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* Nov 15, 2024, 2:12am PST: Core team completes patch for issue\n* Nov 19, 2024, 8:00am PST / 16:00 GMT: Pre-notification delivered\n* Nov 20, 2024, 8:00am PST / 16:00 GMT: Patch made available\n\n\nThis issue was reported by LonelySloth to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on October 31, 2024.

We'll add more detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)\n\n## Mitigations\n\nApart from upgrading, it is recommended to **not** open the gRPC and REST APIs of _validator_ nodes to the public internet. Use isolated and resource-constrained environments for running separate public RPC nodes instead.\nThese can then easily be thrown away and replaced with new instances in case of problems.\n\n## Applying the patch\n\n### Official Wasmd patch\n\nThe patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You will also have to update `libwasmvm` if you build statically.\nIf you already use the latest / close to latest wasmd, you can update more or less as follows:\n\n1. Check the current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`\n2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` dependency in your go.mod to 0.53.2 (Cosmos SDK 0.50 compatible); `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n4. Check the updated wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.53.2.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 2.1.4.\n\nThe patch is not consensus breaking _if you are already using wasmvm 2.1.3_.\nIf you are instead using wasmvm 2.1.2, then upgrading to 2.1.4 includes the consensus breaking changes of 2.1.3.\n\n### DIY Patch\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade to the latest version, you can backport the wasmd patch to your version. The patch is available at [Wasmd 0.53.2](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/compare/v0.53.0...v0.53.2).\nHowever, if you are on an older version of wasmd, you will also be using a different version of wasmvm. We provide the required patches for wasmvm in versions 2.1.4, 2.0.5, 1.5.6.\nTo upgrade using this method:\n\n1. Check the current wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and upgrade\n   to the closest patched version.\n2. Bump the github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm dependency in your go.mod to the closest compatible patched version (either 2.1.4, 2.0.5 or 1.5.6); go mod tidy; commit.\n3. Apply the patch linked above to your version of wasmd.\n4. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 2.1.4, 2.0.5 or 1.5.6 and must be the same as the wasmvm version in your go.sum.\n\nThe patch is not consensus breaking as long as you were using the previous patch version of wasmvm before.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis issue was found by meadow101 who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne.\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the\nprogram by reporting a bug, please see <https://hackerone.com/cosmos>.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2024-09-25: Confio receives a report through the Cosmos bug bounty program maintained by Amulet.\n- 2024-09-30: Confio security contributors confirm the report.\n- 2024-11-21: Confio developed the patch internally.\n- 2024-12-06: Patch release is pre-announced through notification lists.\n- 2024-12-10: Patch released.\n\n[^1]: following Amulet's Severity Classification Framework ACMv1: https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/e0227a1fb4059144aab4f6003eeee7f09912db3a/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md"}, {"id": "GHSA-23qp-3c2m-xx6w", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm to 1.5.8", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm: wasmvm: Malicious smart contract can crash the chain", "ruleId": "trivy-GHSA-23qp-3c2m-xx6w", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/core/scripts/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "medium", "references": ["https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2025-001.md", "https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm", "https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/commit/0aefa4c378457aeb3c07e7975b875be38872c56d"], "description": "# CWA-2025-001\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.2\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.5\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.6\n- wasmvm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.8, 2.0.6, 2.1.5, 2.2.2\n\n## Description of the bug\n\nThe vulnerability can be used to crash the chain.

The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core's \"FindAndDelete()\" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a \"standard\" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = \"<data> <data||foo>\"` and `dataToRemove = \"data\"` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push.

Additional validation was added to prevent this condition from happening.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new CometBFT releases [v1.0.1](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1) and [v0.38.17](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17) fix this issue.\n\nUnreleased code in the main branch is patched as well.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue. If a node is producing these malicious proofs, the only mitigation is to upgrade CometBFT. After upgrading, the validators then will eventually conclude the correct value.\n\n### Technical Deep-Dive\n\nWhen the next proposer creates a block, it is split into many block parts (64kB each). Each block part is then disseminated via p2p layer in a gossip fashion. The block part contains the following fields:\n\n```go\ntype Part struct {\n\tIndex uint32            `json:\"index\"`\n\tBytes cmtbytes.HexBytes `json:\"bytes\"`\n\tProof merkle.Proof      `json:\"proof\"`\n}\n```\n\n- `Index` - represents the index of a block part\n- `Bytes` - the actual content\n- `Proof` - Merkle proof, which allows the receiving node to quickly verify that a `Part` is indeed a piece of the proposed block.\n\nThe `Proof` contains the following fields:\n\n```go\ntype Proof struct {\n\tTotal    int64    `json:\"total\"`           // Total number of items.\n\tIndex    int64    `json:\"index\"`           // Index of item to prove.\n\tLeafHash []byte   `json:\"leaf_hash\"`       // Hash of item value.\n\tAunts    [][]byte `json:\"aunts,omitempty\"` // Hashes from leaf's sibling to a root's child.\n}\n```\n\nNote that the total number of leaves in the Merkle tree equals the number of parts in the proposed block. Previously, CometBFT did not validate the `Index` field and specifically that `Part.Index` must be equal to `Part.Proof.Index`. This leads to a condition where, it is possible to use the proof from a different part and CometBFT accept it, even though the proof proves the different part is a piece of the proposed block and not the part that the peer actually sent to us.\n\nThis condition is problematic because: \n\n1. it would disseminate the invalid block part to its neighboring nodes (because it deemed it as correct)\n2. it would mark the block part as received and ask the neighboring nodes not to relay it in the future, making it impossible to receive the correct block part.\n\nTo address this, CometBFT was patched to verify that `Part.Index` is equal to `Part.Proof.Index`, preventing the above condition.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* January 15, 2025, 12:12pm PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* January 15, 2025, 12:31pm PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* January 27, 2025, 11:28pm PST: Core team completes validation of issue\n* January 31, 2024, 2:15pm PST: Pre-notification delivered\n* February 3rd, 2024, 9:00am UTC+4: Patch made available\n\nThis issue was reported by [unknown_feature](https://github.com/unknownfeature) to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 15, 2025.

In the `blocksync` protocol peers send their `base` and `latest` heights when they connect to a new node (`A`), which is syncing to the tip of a network. `base` acts as a lower ground and informs `A` that the peer only has blocks starting from height `base`. `latest` height informs `A` about the latest block in a network. Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights. The existing code however doesn't check for the case where `B` first reports `latest` height `X` and immediately after height `Y`, where `X > Y`. `A` will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. This condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting some non-existing `latest` height, then reporting lower `latest` height and nodes which are syncing using `blocksync` protocol.

If the conditions of both of these parameters are exceeded, evidence may be prematurely expired and considered no longer valid, potentially allowing for unpunished Byzantine behavior if evidence is discovered outside of that window.\n\n## Next Steps for Chains and Validators\n\nIt is recommended that chain ecosystems and their maintainers set the consensus parameters `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeNumBlocks` and `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeDuration` to values appropriate for their use case:  \n- `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeDuration` (set in nanoseconds) should exceed the duration of the chain’s unbonding period\n- `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeNumBlocks` should exceed the number of estimated blocks that will be produced by your chain throughout the unbonding period\n\nFor more information about evidence in CometBFT, please see: https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/consensus/evidence.\n\nFor more information about the cosmos-sdk  `x/staking` and `x/slashing` modules, and `UnbondingTime` parameter, please see: https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules/staking and https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules/slashing.\n\nCometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. \n\nAs more chains adopt the Interchain Stack for new and cutting-edge use cases, the CometBFT team recommends that all chains regularly evaluate their consensus parameters and configurations to ensure they meet the needs of their ecosystem as their networks mature. \n\nA Github Security Advisory for this issue is available in the [CometBFT repository](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-555p-m4v6-cqxv).

In order for this node to be ready to run consensus and block sync from the installed snapshot height, we also need to install a valid `State` in the node, which is the starting state from which it is able to validate new blocks and append them to the blockchain.\n\nThe `State` object used by state sync is computed using the light client protocol, which retrieves information about committed blocks from at least two RPC endpoints. The light client protocol performs several state validations and, in particular, compares the state provided by different RPC endpoints, looking for inconsistencies.\n\nThe `State` object contains, among other fields, a `Validators` field which stores the current validator set. A validator set is a list of validator addresses, public keys and associated voting powers, one per validator. It also stores, for historical reasons, the state of the proposer selection algorithm, in the form of the `ProposerPriority` field associated with each `Validator`.\n\nWhile the light client is able to validate the `ValidatorSet` retrieved from RPC endpoints, this validation does not include the `ProposerPriority` field associated with each `Validator`. As a result, when state sync adopts RPC endpoints that, for unknown reasons, provide an invalid state of the proposer selection algorithm, the node will not be able to properly run the consensus protocol, as their local view of which validator is the proposer of a given round and height will disagree with the views of the correct validators. If an increasing number of validators state sync using RPC endpoints with invalid states, the network eventually halts.\n\n### Patches\n\nRelease versions 0.34.34, 0.37.11, and 0.38.12 include a patch to address this issue.\n\nIn the patched versions, the light client protocol compares the `ProposerPriority` fields of the `ValidatorSet` instances retrieved from the RPC endpoints configured for state sync. If they differ, the computed `State` object is considered invalid and state sync will fail with an error.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue is observed when validators run state sync using RPC nodes that are malicious or report invalid states for the proposer selection algorithm.\n\nIt is worth noting that non-malicious nodes running upstream software should never report an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm. This situation may result from the adoption of nodes with customized code or which had their state, stored in local databases, manually updated.\n\nWhen the network public's RPC endpoints have an invalid state for the proposer election algorithm, there, new validators should refrain from using state sync for bootstrapping or be sure that they configure for state sync RPC endpoints with a valid state of the proposer election algorithm.\n\nA validator with an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm will reject most of the proposed blocks and will have the network rejecting blocks it has proposed.  It is also possible to manually compare the state of the proposer election algorithm of nodes by comparing the outputs of the `/validators?height=_`  RPC endpoints. The outputs must fully match, including the ProposerPriority field associated with each validator. \n\n\n### References\n\n* [State Sync documentation](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/core/state-sync)\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on 12/08/24.

It is advised that chains consider their specific needs for their use case when setting the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` consensus parameter. Chains are encouraged to evaluate the impact of having proposed blocks with the maximum allowed block size, especially on bandwidth usage and block latency. Additionally, the `timeout_propose` parameter should be computed using the maximum allowed block size as a reference. This issue does not represent an actively exploitable vulnerability that would result in a direct loss of funds, however it may have a slight impact on block latency depending on a network’s topography.\n\nWhen setting a large `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, there are two main implications:\n* Increased bandwidth to propagate a block\n* Increased latency to propagate a block\n\nWhen combined, this may result in less round participation, and in some cases additional rounds may be required to meet the consensus threshold, which could lead to timeouts depending on the topography of a network and environmental factors. These factors can include the number of validators on a network, geographic distribution, network connectivity (including latency, bandwidth, and reachability), the functionality of the modules implementing the logic for a transaction in your chain, etc.  The cost to propagate a 21MB block, the default value for `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, will be far higher than the cost of propagating a smaller 1MB block. CometBFT recommends tuning this parameter to a smaller limit if full initial-round participation is an important quality for your chain.\n\n# Considerations\nCometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. A high-performing validator may find it necessary to experiment with tuning local configuration, optimizing network and compute resources, and implementing controls to inhibit spam.\n\n\n# Next Steps for Chains and Validators\n\nTo increase awareness of the potential impacts of this default parameter, the CometBFT team has updated the documentation (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1405, [v0.34.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.34/spec/abci/apps#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.37.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.38.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes)) for builders and maintainers of chain applications. Additionally, it is recommended that:\n\n\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers set a `BlockParams.MaxBytes` configuration appropriate for their use case at the application level; in some cases, fine-tuning `BlockParams` may require a network upgrade.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers evaluate how gas is used and required on their chain, including gas and fee parameters, no-fee or fee-exempt message policies, and ensure that any custom modules integrate with the gas and fee frameworks. This is especially important for chains that may have implemented custom modules or functionality to allow IBC messages to bypass fees.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers audit all of their currently-set parameters and configurations to ensure that they are appropriate for their use case.\n\n* All validators develop and implement anti-spam measures on their nodes. Amulet encourages validators to form working groups to collaborate on spam prevention and on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n* All validators consider developing and implementing tooling that would allow them to sample incoming transactions to enable them to fine-tune the level of service they would like to provide to be resilient in slowdown scenarios. Amulet also encourages validators to collaborate on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n\n\nThe CometBFT team has also revisited all the checks performed by the consensus protocol regarding proposed blocks. This investigation has confirmed that proposed blocks with size exceeding the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` limit established by the application are not accepted by nodes. The team notwithstanding has decided to introduce additional sanity checks for the size of proposed blocks (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1408), allowing for an early identification and rejection of invalid or oversized blocks. These code changes will be included in the _next_ release of each branch of CometBFT.\n\nAs more chains adopt the Interchain Stack for new and cutting-edge use cases, the CometBFT team recommends that all chains regularly evaluate their parameters and configurations to ensure they meet the needs of their ecosystem as their networks mature. \n\n\nFor more information about CometBFT, see [https://docs.cometbft.com](https://docs.cometbft.com/). \n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue was reported via the vulnerability disclosure channel at [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io) on Friday, September 23, 2023.

All versions of the `x/crisis` module are affected on all versions of the Cosmos SDK.\n\n### Details\nThe `x/crisis` module is supposed to allow anyone to halt a chain in the event of a violated invariant by sending a `MsgVerifyInvariant` with the name of the invariant. Processing this message takes extra processing power hence a `ConstantFee` was introduced on the chain that is charged as extra from the reporter for the extra computational work. This is supposed to avert spammers on the chain making nodes do extra computations using this transaction. By not charging the `ConstantFee`, the transactions related to invariant checking are relatively cheaper compared to the computational need and other transactions.\n\nThat said, the submitter still has to pay the transaction fee to put the transaction on the network, hence using this weakness for spamming is limited by the usual mechanisms.\n\nSynthetic testing showed up to a 20% increase in CPU usage on a validator node that is spammed by hundreds of `MsgVerifyInvariant` messages which still makes this an expensive operation to carry out on a live blockchain network.\n\n### Patches\nThe `ConstantFee` charge of the `x/crisis` module will either be fixed or disabled in an upcoming regular release of the Cosmos SDK.\n\nThe `x/crisis` module was originally intended to allow chains to halt rather than continue with some unknown behavior in the case of an invariant violation (safety over liveness). However, as chains mature, and especially as the potential [cost of halting increases](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/570), chains should consider carefully what invariants they really want to halt for, and what invariants are just sort of helpful sanity checks.\n\nThe SDK team is working on new modules that allow chain developers to fine-tune the chain invariants and the necessary actions.\n\nHence, the decision was made that the `x/crisis` module will be deprecated when new modules take over its responsibilities.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround posted. Validators are advised to leave some extra computing room on their servers for possible spamming scenarios. (This is a good measure in any case.)\n\n### References\nSDK developer epic about invariant checking: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/15706\n"}, {"id": "GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v7 to 7.10.0", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v7: IBC-Go: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in a chain halt", "ruleId": "trivy-GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/core/scripts/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "critical", "references": ["https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go", "https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.10.0", "https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.7.0"], "description": "Name: ISA-2025-001: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in a chain halt\nComponent: IBC-Go\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected versions: IBC-Go >= v7; Earlier IBC-Go versions MAY also be affected.\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes, IBC Middleware authors\n\n### Description\n\nAn issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain.

Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new IBC-Go releases below address this issue:\n\n* [v7.9.2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.9.2)\n* [v8.6.1](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.6.1)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo prevent this state from being introduced to a chain, it is possible to permission Channel Opening as a workaround.\n\n### Notes on Re-Release\n\n#### Is this state breaking? Probably not but it depends on your transfer middlewares\n\nThis patch is not state breaking unless you depend on transfer middlewares that deserialize and serialize acknowledgement packets before passing them to the transfer handler.  As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch. So if these are the only transfer middlewares you depend on, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).\n\n#### What to do if you do depend on ack-serializing middleware\n\nIn the unlikely case that you depend on middlewares that serialize ack packets and you do not update them when you apply this patch, all transfers that are handled by the middleware will fail (or experience other unexpected behavior) if the serialization approach differs from the transfer app's. If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.\n\nTo update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: `transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON`, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:\n\n```\nimport transfertypes \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types\"\ntransfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON\nfunc MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {\n\treturn transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&ack)\n}\n```\nWhen you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade. So for absolute clarity: chains with these ack-serializing middlewares must do coordinated upgrades\n\n#### Why we retracted the earlier patch in favor of this approach\nWe retracted the releases of ibc-go we cut earlier today because these broke all transfer middlewares that deserialized then re-serialized receive packets differently than the transfer app. It turned out that this was a common pattern (unlike serializing/deserializing ack packets), so widely used middlewares, including packet-forward-middleware, broke unexpectedly.\n\nIn the new set of patches, we removed this constraint on how middlewares serialize receive packets, preventing this breakage. Only the serialization requirement on acknowledgement packets remains. This is convenient because this is the only constraint we had to add to fix the vulnerability, and middlewares that deserialize and serialize ack packets are much less common than ones that do so for receive packets. The constraint on receive packets was added for defense in depth.\n\n#### Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release\n* In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:\n* Tested pfm v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Ran a patched node on mainnet on the cosmos hub and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM\n* Ran a patched node on osmosis and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks\nThis is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* February 18, 2025, 4:54am PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* February 18, 2025, 6:56am PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* February 18, 2025, 8:15am PST: Core team completes validation of issue\n* February 25, 2025, 8:00am PST / 17:00 CET: Pre-notification delivered\n* February 27, 2025, 8:00am PST / 17:00 CET: Patch made available\n* February 27, 2025, 1:00pm PST: Patch re-release made available\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by swelf19 on HackerOne on February 18, 2025.

To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments running directly on affected hardware. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/"}, {"id": "CVE-2025-54410", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/docker/docker to 28.0.0", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/docker/docker: github.com/moby/moby: Moby's Firewalld reload removes bridge network isolation", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2025-54410", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/core/scripts/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "low", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-54410", "https://firewalld.org/documentation/howto/reload-firewalld.html", "https://github.com/moby/moby"], "description": "Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products.

If this error is encountered, the program should handshake again to start with a fresh `CipherState`.\n\n### Issue 2: Potential denial of service via invalid ciphertext\n\nIf an attacker sends an invalid ciphertext into one peer's `Decrypt`, the nonce is incremented unconditionally. This causes a desync of the `CipherState` due to a nonce mismatch between the peers, resulting in a failure to decrypt all subsequent messages. A new handshake will be required to establish a new `CipherState`.\n\nThis has been resolved in the patched version by returning authentication errors from `Decrypt` before incrementing the nonce. \n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in https://github.com/flynn/noise/pull/44, tagged as v1.0.0.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThese issues were discovered during [an audit](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/cure53-turbotunnel-2021.pdf) of a user of this package ([dnstt](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/)).

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance."}, {"id": "CVE-2025-22869", "fix": {"template": "Update golang.org/x/crypto to 0.35.0", "available": true}, "title": "golang.org/x/crypto: golang.org/x/crypto/ssh: Denial of Service in the Key Exchange of golang.org/x/crypto/ssh", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2025-22869", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/core/scripts/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "high", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:3833", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-22869", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2348367"], "description": "SSH servers which implement file transfer protocols are vulnerable to a denial of service attack from clients which complete the key exchange slowly, or not at all, causing pending content to be read into memory, but never transmitted."}, {"id": "CVE-2023-48795", "fix": {"template": "Update golang.org/x/crypto to 0.17.0, 0.0.0-20231218163308-9d2ee975ef9f", "available": true}, "title": "golang.org/x/crypto: ssh: Prefix truncation attack on Binary Packet Protocol (BPP)", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2023-48795", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/core/scripts/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "medium", "references": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176280/Terrapin-SSH-Connection-Weakening.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Mar/21", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/18/3"], "description": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack.

If your chain interacts with APIs in the cosmossdk.io/math package, or utilizes a module that consumes this library, it is advised to update to the latest version at the time of the patch release by updating your project's go.mod dependency for cosmossdk.io/math.\n\nThe patch can be applied without a hard-fork, and with a version bump in a chain's go.mod file like the following:\n\n#### `go.mod`\n\n```diff\n- cosmossdk.io/math v1.3.0\n+ cosmossdk.io/math v1.4.0\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> When on a lower version than cosmossdk.io/math v1.3.0, please do a coordinated upgrade before upgrading to >= 1.3.0\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new release of `cosmossdk.io/math v1.4.0` resolves this issue.  Chains that utilize the cosmossdk.io/math library or modules that utilize the cosmossdk.io/math library should update to avoid this condition.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* October 31, 2024, 6:55pm UTC: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* October 31, 2024, 8:56pm UTC: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* Nov 15, 2024, 2:12am PST: Core team completes patch for issue\n* Nov 19, 2024, 8:00am PST / 16:00 GMT: Pre-notification delivered\n* Nov 20, 2024, 8:00am PST / 16:00 GMT: Patch made available\n\n\nThis issue was reported by LonelySloth to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on October 31, 2024.

We'll add more detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)\n\n## Mitigations\n\nApart from upgrading, it is recommended to **not** open the gRPC and REST APIs of _validator_ nodes to the public internet. Use isolated and resource-constrained environments for running separate public RPC nodes instead.\nThese can then easily be thrown away and replaced with new instances in case of problems.\n\n## Applying the patch\n\n### Official Wasmd patch\n\nThe patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You will also have to update `libwasmvm` if you build statically.\nIf you already use the latest / close to latest wasmd, you can update more or less as follows:\n\n1. Check the current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`\n2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` dependency in your go.mod to 0.53.2 (Cosmos SDK 0.50 compatible); `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n4. Check the updated wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.53.2.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 2.1.4.\n\nThe patch is not consensus breaking _if you are already using wasmvm 2.1.3_.\nIf you are instead using wasmvm 2.1.2, then upgrading to 2.1.4 includes the consensus breaking changes of 2.1.3.\n\n### DIY Patch\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade to the latest version, you can backport the wasmd patch to your version. The patch is available at [Wasmd 0.53.2](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/compare/v0.53.0...v0.53.2).\nHowever, if you are on an older version of wasmd, you will also be using a different version of wasmvm. We provide the required patches for wasmvm in versions 2.1.4, 2.0.5, 1.5.6.\nTo upgrade using this method:\n\n1. Check the current wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and upgrade\n   to the closest patched version.\n2. Bump the github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm dependency in your go.mod to the closest compatible patched version (either 2.1.4, 2.0.5 or 1.5.6); go mod tidy; commit.\n3. Apply the patch linked above to your version of wasmd.\n4. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 2.1.4, 2.0.5 or 1.5.6 and must be the same as the wasmvm version in your go.sum.\n\nThe patch is not consensus breaking as long as you were using the previous patch version of wasmvm before.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis issue was found by meadow101 who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne.\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the\nprogram by reporting a bug, please see <https://hackerone.com/cosmos>.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2024-09-25: Confio receives a report through the Cosmos bug bounty program maintained by Amulet.\n- 2024-09-30: Confio security contributors confirm the report.\n- 2024-11-21: Confio developed the patch internally.\n- 2024-12-06: Patch release is pre-announced through notification lists.\n- 2024-12-10: Patch released.\n\n[^1]: following Amulet's Severity Classification Framework ACMv1: https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/e0227a1fb4059144aab4f6003eeee7f09912db3a/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md"}, {"id": "GHSA-23qp-3c2m-xx6w", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm to 1.5.8", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm: wasmvm: Malicious smart contract can crash the chain", "ruleId": "trivy-GHSA-23qp-3c2m-xx6w", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "medium", "references": ["https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2025-001.md", "https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm", "https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/commit/0aefa4c378457aeb3c07e7975b875be38872c56d"], "description": "# CWA-2025-001\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.2\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.5\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.6\n- wasmvm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.8, 2.0.6, 2.1.5, 2.2.2\n\n## Description of the bug\n\nThe vulnerability can be used to crash the chain.

This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a \"standard\" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = \"<data> <data||foo>\"` and `dataToRemove = \"data\"` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push.

Additional validation was added to prevent this condition from happening.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new CometBFT releases [v1.0.1](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1) and [v0.38.17](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17) fix this issue.\n\nUnreleased code in the main branch is patched as well.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue. If a node is producing these malicious proofs, the only mitigation is to upgrade CometBFT. After upgrading, the validators then will eventually conclude the correct value.\n\n### Technical Deep-Dive\n\nWhen the next proposer creates a block, it is split into many block parts (64kB each). Each block part is then disseminated via p2p layer in a gossip fashion. The block part contains the following fields:\n\n```go\ntype Part struct {\n\tIndex uint32            `json:\"index\"`\n\tBytes cmtbytes.HexBytes `json:\"bytes\"`\n\tProof merkle.Proof      `json:\"proof\"`\n}\n```\n\n- `Index` - represents the index of a block part\n- `Bytes` - the actual content\n- `Proof` - Merkle proof, which allows the receiving node to quickly verify that a `Part` is indeed a piece of the proposed block.\n\nThe `Proof` contains the following fields:\n\n```go\ntype Proof struct {\n\tTotal    int64    `json:\"total\"`           // Total number of items.\n\tIndex    int64    `json:\"index\"`           // Index of item to prove.\n\tLeafHash []byte   `json:\"leaf_hash\"`       // Hash of item value.\n\tAunts    [][]byte `json:\"aunts,omitempty\"` // Hashes from leaf's sibling to a root's child.\n}\n```\n\nNote that the total number of leaves in the Merkle tree equals the number of parts in the proposed block. Previously, CometBFT did not validate the `Index` field and specifically that `Part.Index` must be equal to `Part.Proof.Index`. This leads to a condition where, it is possible to use the proof from a different part and CometBFT accept it, even though the proof proves the different part is a piece of the proposed block and not the part that the peer actually sent to us.\n\nThis condition is problematic because: \n\n1. it would disseminate the invalid block part to its neighboring nodes (because it deemed it as correct)\n2. it would mark the block part as received and ask the neighboring nodes not to relay it in the future, making it impossible to receive the correct block part.\n\nTo address this, CometBFT was patched to verify that `Part.Index` is equal to `Part.Proof.Index`, preventing the above condition.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* January 15, 2025, 12:12pm PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* January 15, 2025, 12:31pm PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* January 27, 2025, 11:28pm PST: Core team completes validation of issue\n* January 31, 2024, 2:15pm PST: Pre-notification delivered\n* February 3rd, 2024, 9:00am UTC+4: Patch made available\n\nThis issue was reported by [unknown_feature](https://github.com/unknownfeature) to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 15, 2025.

Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights.

The default values for `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeNumBlocks` and `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeDuration` consensus parameters may not be sufficient for common use cases to provide coverage for the entire unbonding period for a chain (`Staking.UnbondingTime`). If the conditions of both of these parameters are exceeded, evidence may be prematurely expired and considered no longer valid, potentially allowing for unpunished Byzantine behavior if evidence is discovered outside of that window.\n\n## Next Steps for Chains and Validators\n\nIt is recommended that chain ecosystems and their maintainers set the consensus parameters `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeNumBlocks` and `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeDuration` to values appropriate for their use case:  \n- `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeDuration` (set in nanoseconds) should exceed the duration of the chain’s unbonding period\n- `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeNumBlocks` should exceed the number of estimated blocks that will be produced by your chain throughout the unbonding period\n\nFor more information about evidence in CometBFT, please see: https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/consensus/evidence.\n\nFor more information about the cosmos-sdk  `x/staking` and `x/slashing` modules, and `UnbondingTime` parameter, please see: https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules/staking and https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules/slashing.\n\nCometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. \n\nAs more chains adopt the Interchain Stack for new and cutting-edge use cases, the CometBFT team recommends that all chains regularly evaluate their consensus parameters and configurations to ensure they meet the needs of their ecosystem as their networks mature. \n\nA Github Security Advisory for this issue is available in the [CometBFT repository](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-555p-m4v6-cqxv).

In order for this node to be ready to run consensus and block sync from the installed snapshot height, we also need to install a valid `State` in the node, which is the starting state from which it is able to validate new blocks and append them to the blockchain.\n\nThe `State` object used by state sync is computed using the light client protocol, which retrieves information about committed blocks from at least two RPC endpoints. The light client protocol performs several state validations and, in particular, compares the state provided by different RPC endpoints, looking for inconsistencies.\n\nThe `State` object contains, among other fields, a `Validators` field which stores the current validator set. A validator set is a list of validator addresses, public keys and associated voting powers, one per validator. It also stores, for historical reasons, the state of the proposer selection algorithm, in the form of the `ProposerPriority` field associated with each `Validator`.\n\nWhile the light client is able to validate the `ValidatorSet` retrieved from RPC endpoints, this validation does not include the `ProposerPriority` field associated with each `Validator`. As a result, when state sync adopts RPC endpoints that, for unknown reasons, provide an invalid state of the proposer selection algorithm, the node will not be able to properly run the consensus protocol, as their local view of which validator is the proposer of a given round and height will disagree with the views of the correct validators. If an increasing number of validators state sync using RPC endpoints with invalid states, the network eventually halts.\n\n### Patches\n\nRelease versions 0.34.34, 0.37.11, and 0.38.12 include a patch to address this issue.\n\nIn the patched versions, the light client protocol compares the `ProposerPriority` fields of the `ValidatorSet` instances retrieved from the RPC endpoints configured for state sync. If they differ, the computed `State` object is considered invalid and state sync will fail with an error.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue is observed when validators run state sync using RPC nodes that are malicious or report invalid states for the proposer selection algorithm.\n\nIt is worth noting that non-malicious nodes running upstream software should never report an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm. This situation may result from the adoption of nodes with customized code or which had their state, stored in local databases, manually updated.\n\nWhen the network public's RPC endpoints have an invalid state for the proposer election algorithm, there, new validators should refrain from using state sync for bootstrapping or be sure that they configure for state sync RPC endpoints with a valid state of the proposer election algorithm.\n\nA validator with an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm will reject most of the proposed blocks and will have the network rejecting blocks it has proposed.  It is also possible to manually compare the state of the proposer election algorithm of nodes by comparing the outputs of the `/validators?height=_`  RPC endpoints. The outputs must fully match, including the ProposerPriority field associated with each validator. \n\n\n### References\n\n* [State Sync documentation](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/core/state-sync)\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on 12/08/24.

It is advised that chains consider their specific needs for their use case when setting the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` consensus parameter. Chains are encouraged to evaluate the impact of having proposed blocks with the maximum allowed block size, especially on bandwidth usage and block latency. Additionally, the `timeout_propose` parameter should be computed using the maximum allowed block size as a reference. This issue does not represent an actively exploitable vulnerability that would result in a direct loss of funds, however it may have a slight impact on block latency depending on a network’s topography.\n\nWhen setting a large `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, there are two main implications:\n* Increased bandwidth to propagate a block\n* Increased latency to propagate a block\n\nWhen combined, this may result in less round participation, and in some cases additional rounds may be required to meet the consensus threshold, which could lead to timeouts depending on the topography of a network and environmental factors. These factors can include the number of validators on a network, geographic distribution, network connectivity (including latency, bandwidth, and reachability), the functionality of the modules implementing the logic for a transaction in your chain, etc.  The cost to propagate a 21MB block, the default value for `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, will be far higher than the cost of propagating a smaller 1MB block. CometBFT recommends tuning this parameter to a smaller limit if full initial-round participation is an important quality for your chain.\n\n# Considerations\nCometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. A high-performing validator may find it necessary to experiment with tuning local configuration, optimizing network and compute resources, and implementing controls to inhibit spam.\n\n\n# Next Steps for Chains and Validators\n\nTo increase awareness of the potential impacts of this default parameter, the CometBFT team has updated the documentation (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1405, [v0.34.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.34/spec/abci/apps#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.37.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.38.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes)) for builders and maintainers of chain applications. Additionally, it is recommended that:\n\n\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers set a `BlockParams.MaxBytes` configuration appropriate for their use case at the application level; in some cases, fine-tuning `BlockParams` may require a network upgrade.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers evaluate how gas is used and required on their chain, including gas and fee parameters, no-fee or fee-exempt message policies, and ensure that any custom modules integrate with the gas and fee frameworks. This is especially important for chains that may have implemented custom modules or functionality to allow IBC messages to bypass fees.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers audit all of their currently-set parameters and configurations to ensure that they are appropriate for their use case.\n\n* All validators develop and implement anti-spam measures on their nodes. Amulet encourages validators to form working groups to collaborate on spam prevention and on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n* All validators consider developing and implementing tooling that would allow them to sample incoming transactions to enable them to fine-tune the level of service they would like to provide to be resilient in slowdown scenarios. Amulet also encourages validators to collaborate on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n\n\nThe CometBFT team has also revisited all the checks performed by the consensus protocol regarding proposed blocks. This investigation has confirmed that proposed blocks with size exceeding the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` limit established by the application are not accepted by nodes. The team notwithstanding has decided to introduce additional sanity checks for the size of proposed blocks (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1408), allowing for an early identification and rejection of invalid or oversized blocks. These code changes will be included in the _next_ release of each branch of CometBFT.\n\nAs more chains adopt the Interchain Stack for new and cutting-edge use cases, the CometBFT team recommends that all chains regularly evaluate their parameters and configurations to ensure they meet the needs of their ecosystem as their networks mature. \n\n\nFor more information about CometBFT, see [https://docs.cometbft.com](https://docs.cometbft.com/). \n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue was reported via the vulnerability disclosure channel at [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io) on Friday, September 23, 2023.

All versions of the `x/crisis` module are affected on all versions of the Cosmos SDK.\n\n### Details\nThe `x/crisis` module is supposed to allow anyone to halt a chain in the event of a violated invariant by sending a `MsgVerifyInvariant` with the name of the invariant. Processing this message takes extra processing power hence a `ConstantFee` was introduced on the chain that is charged as extra from the reporter for the extra computational work. This is supposed to avert spammers on the chain making nodes do extra computations using this transaction. By not charging the `ConstantFee`, the transactions related to invariant checking are relatively cheaper compared to the computational need and other transactions.\n\nThat said, the submitter still has to pay the transaction fee to put the transaction on the network, hence using this weakness for spamming is limited by the usual mechanisms.\n\nSynthetic testing showed up to a 20% increase in CPU usage on a validator node that is spammed by hundreds of `MsgVerifyInvariant` messages which still makes this an expensive operation to carry out on a live blockchain network.\n\n### Patches\nThe `ConstantFee` charge of the `x/crisis` module will either be fixed or disabled in an upcoming regular release of the Cosmos SDK.\n\nThe `x/crisis` module was originally intended to allow chains to halt rather than continue with some unknown behavior in the case of an invariant violation (safety over liveness). However, as chains mature, and especially as the potential [cost of halting increases](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/570), chains should consider carefully what invariants they really want to halt for, and what invariants are just sort of helpful sanity checks.\n\nThe SDK team is working on new modules that allow chain developers to fine-tune the chain invariants and the necessary actions.\n\nHence, the decision was made that the `x/crisis` module will be deprecated when new modules take over its responsibilities.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround posted. Validators are advised to leave some extra computing room on their servers for possible spamming scenarios. (This is a good measure in any case.)\n\n### References\nSDK developer epic about invariant checking: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/15706\n"}, {"id": "GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v7 to 7.10.0", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v7: IBC-Go: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in a chain halt", "ruleId": "trivy-GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "critical", "references": ["https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go", "https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.10.0", "https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.7.0"], "description": "Name: ISA-2025-001: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in a chain halt\nComponent: IBC-Go\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected versions: IBC-Go >= v7; Earlier IBC-Go versions MAY also be affected.\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes, IBC Middleware authors\n\n### Description\n\nAn issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain.

Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new IBC-Go releases below address this issue:\n\n* [v7.9.2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.9.2)\n* [v8.6.1](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.6.1)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo prevent this state from being introduced to a chain, it is possible to permission Channel Opening as a workaround.\n\n### Notes on Re-Release\n\n#### Is this state breaking? Probably not but it depends on your transfer middlewares\n\nThis patch is not state breaking unless you depend on transfer middlewares that deserialize and serialize acknowledgement packets before passing them to the transfer handler.  As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch. So if these are the only transfer middlewares you depend on, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).\n\n#### What to do if you do depend on ack-serializing middleware\n\nIn the unlikely case that you depend on middlewares that serialize ack packets and you do not update them when you apply this patch, all transfers that are handled by the middleware will fail (or experience other unexpected behavior) if the serialization approach differs from the transfer app's. If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.\n\nTo update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: `transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON`, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:\n\n```\nimport transfertypes \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types\"\ntransfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON\nfunc MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {\n\treturn transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&ack)\n}\n```\nWhen you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade. So for absolute clarity: chains with these ack-serializing middlewares must do coordinated upgrades\n\n#### Why we retracted the earlier patch in favor of this approach\nWe retracted the releases of ibc-go we cut earlier today because these broke all transfer middlewares that deserialized then re-serialized receive packets differently than the transfer app. It turned out that this was a common pattern (unlike serializing/deserializing ack packets), so widely used middlewares, including packet-forward-middleware, broke unexpectedly.\n\nIn the new set of patches, we removed this constraint on how middlewares serialize receive packets, preventing this breakage. Only the serialization requirement on acknowledgement packets remains. This is convenient because this is the only constraint we had to add to fix the vulnerability, and middlewares that deserialize and serialize ack packets are much less common than ones that do so for receive packets. The constraint on receive packets was added for defense in depth.\n\n#### Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release\n* In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:\n* Tested pfm v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Ran a patched node on mainnet on the cosmos hub and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM\n* Ran a patched node on osmosis and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks\nThis is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* February 18, 2025, 4:54am PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* February 18, 2025, 6:56am PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* February 18, 2025, 8:15am PST: Core team completes validation of issue\n* February 25, 2025, 8:00am PST / 17:00 CET: Pre-notification delivered\n* February 27, 2025, 8:00am PST / 17:00 CET: Patch made available\n* February 27, 2025, 1:00pm PST: Patch re-release made available\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by swelf19 on HackerOne on February 18, 2025.

If this error is encountered, the program should handshake again to start with a fresh `CipherState`.\n\n### Issue 2: Potential denial of service via invalid ciphertext\n\nIf an attacker sends an invalid ciphertext into one peer's `Decrypt`, the nonce is incremented unconditionally. This causes a desync of the `CipherState` due to a nonce mismatch between the peers, resulting in a failure to decrypt all subsequent messages. A new handshake will be required to establish a new `CipherState`.\n\nThis has been resolved in the patched version by returning authentication errors from `Decrypt` before incrementing the nonce. \n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in https://github.com/flynn/noise/pull/44, tagged as v1.0.0.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThese issues were discovered during [an audit](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/cure53-turbotunnel-2021.pdf) of a user of this package ([dnstt](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/)).

Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2.

This issue was resolved by aligning the max size between the data types in the cosmossdk.io/math package.\n\nThis issue impacts consumers of the cosmossdk.io/math, which includes popular modules including IBC-Go and tokenfactory (permissionless). If your chain interacts with APIs in the cosmossdk.io/math package, or utilizes a module that consumes this library, it is advised to update to the latest version at the time of the patch release by updating your project's go.mod dependency for cosmossdk.io/math.\n\nThe patch can be applied without a hard-fork, and with a version bump in a chain's go.mod file like the following:\n\n#### `go.mod`\n\n```diff\n- cosmossdk.io/math v1.3.0\n+ cosmossdk.io/math v1.4.0\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> When on a lower version than cosmossdk.io/math v1.3.0, please do a coordinated upgrade before upgrading to >= 1.3.0\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new release of `cosmossdk.io/math v1.4.0` resolves this issue.  Chains that utilize the cosmossdk.io/math library or modules that utilize the cosmossdk.io/math library should update to avoid this condition.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* October 31, 2024, 6:55pm UTC: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* October 31, 2024, 8:56pm UTC: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* Nov 15, 2024, 2:12am PST: Core team completes patch for issue\n* Nov 19, 2024, 8:00am PST / 16:00 GMT: Pre-notification delivered\n* Nov 20, 2024, 8:00am PST / 16:00 GMT: Patch made available\n\n\nThis issue was reported by LonelySloth to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on October 31, 2024.

We'll add more detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)\n\n## Mitigations\n\nApart from upgrading, it is recommended to **not** open the gRPC and REST APIs of _validator_ nodes to the public internet. Use isolated and resource-constrained environments for running separate public RPC nodes instead.\nThese can then easily be thrown away and replaced with new instances in case of problems.\n\n## Applying the patch\n\n### Official Wasmd patch\n\nThe patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You will also have to update `libwasmvm` if you build statically.\nIf you already use the latest / close to latest wasmd, you can update more or less as follows:\n\n1. Check the current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`\n2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` dependency in your go.mod to 0.53.2 (Cosmos SDK 0.50 compatible); `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n4. Check the updated wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.53.2.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 2.1.4.\n\nThe patch is not consensus breaking _if you are already using wasmvm 2.1.3_.\nIf you are instead using wasmvm 2.1.2, then upgrading to 2.1.4 includes the consensus breaking changes of 2.1.3.\n\n### DIY Patch\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade to the latest version, you can backport the wasmd patch to your version. The patch is available at [Wasmd 0.53.2](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/compare/v0.53.0...v0.53.2).\nHowever, if you are on an older version of wasmd, you will also be using a different version of wasmvm. We provide the required patches for wasmvm in versions 2.1.4, 2.0.5, 1.5.6.\nTo upgrade using this method:\n\n1. Check the current wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and upgrade\n   to the closest patched version.\n2. Bump the github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm dependency in your go.mod to the closest compatible patched version (either 2.1.4, 2.0.5 or 1.5.6); go mod tidy; commit.\n3. Apply the patch linked above to your version of wasmd.\n4. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 2.1.4, 2.0.5 or 1.5.6 and must be the same as the wasmvm version in your go.sum.\n\nThe patch is not consensus breaking as long as you were using the previous patch version of wasmvm before.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis issue was found by meadow101 who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne.\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the\nprogram by reporting a bug, please see <https://hackerone.com/cosmos>.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2024-09-25: Confio receives a report through the Cosmos bug bounty program maintained by Amulet.\n- 2024-09-30: Confio security contributors confirm the report.\n- 2024-11-21: Confio developed the patch internally.\n- 2024-12-06: Patch release is pre-announced through notification lists.\n- 2024-12-10: Patch released.\n\n[^1]: following Amulet's Severity Classification Framework ACMv1: https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/e0227a1fb4059144aab4f6003eeee7f09912db3a/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md"}, {"id": "GHSA-23qp-3c2m-xx6w", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm to 1.5.8", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm: wasmvm: Malicious smart contract can crash the chain", "ruleId": "trivy-GHSA-23qp-3c2m-xx6w", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/integration-tests/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "medium", "references": ["https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2025-001.md", "https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm", "https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/commit/0aefa4c378457aeb3c07e7975b875be38872c56d"], "description": "# CWA-2025-001\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.2\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.5\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.6\n- wasmvm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.8, 2.0.6, 2.1.5, 2.2.2\n\n## Description of the bug\n\nThe vulnerability can be used to crash the chain.

The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core's \"FindAndDelete()\" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a \"standard\" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = \"<data> <data||foo>\"` and `dataToRemove = \"data\"` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push.

Additional validation was added to prevent this condition from happening.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new CometBFT releases [v1.0.1](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1) and [v0.38.17](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17) fix this issue.\n\nUnreleased code in the main branch is patched as well.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue. If a node is producing these malicious proofs, the only mitigation is to upgrade CometBFT. After upgrading, the validators then will eventually conclude the correct value.\n\n### Technical Deep-Dive\n\nWhen the next proposer creates a block, it is split into many block parts (64kB each). Each block part is then disseminated via p2p layer in a gossip fashion. The block part contains the following fields:\n\n```go\ntype Part struct {\n\tIndex uint32            `json:\"index\"`\n\tBytes cmtbytes.HexBytes `json:\"bytes\"`\n\tProof merkle.Proof      `json:\"proof\"`\n}\n```\n\n- `Index` - represents the index of a block part\n- `Bytes` - the actual content\n- `Proof` - Merkle proof, which allows the receiving node to quickly verify that a `Part` is indeed a piece of the proposed block.\n\nThe `Proof` contains the following fields:\n\n```go\ntype Proof struct {\n\tTotal    int64    `json:\"total\"`           // Total number of items.\n\tIndex    int64    `json:\"index\"`           // Index of item to prove.\n\tLeafHash []byte   `json:\"leaf_hash\"`       // Hash of item value.\n\tAunts    [][]byte `json:\"aunts,omitempty\"` // Hashes from leaf's sibling to a root's child.\n}\n```\n\nNote that the total number of leaves in the Merkle tree equals the number of parts in the proposed block. Previously, CometBFT did not validate the `Index` field and specifically that `Part.Index` must be equal to `Part.Proof.Index`. This leads to a condition where, it is possible to use the proof from a different part and CometBFT accept it, even though the proof proves the different part is a piece of the proposed block and not the part that the peer actually sent to us.\n\nThis condition is problematic because: \n\n1. it would disseminate the invalid block part to its neighboring nodes (because it deemed it as correct)\n2. it would mark the block part as received and ask the neighboring nodes not to relay it in the future, making it impossible to receive the correct block part.\n\nTo address this, CometBFT was patched to verify that `Part.Index` is equal to `Part.Proof.Index`, preventing the above condition.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* January 15, 2025, 12:12pm PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* January 15, 2025, 12:31pm PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* January 27, 2025, 11:28pm PST: Core team completes validation of issue\n* January 31, 2024, 2:15pm PST: Pre-notification delivered\n* February 3rd, 2024, 9:00am UTC+4: Patch made available\n\nThis issue was reported by [unknown_feature](https://github.com/unknownfeature) to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 15, 2025.

Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights.

In order for this node to be ready to run consensus and block sync from the installed snapshot height, we also need to install a valid `State` in the node, which is the starting state from which it is able to validate new blocks and append them to the blockchain.\n\nThe `State` object used by state sync is computed using the light client protocol, which retrieves information about committed blocks from at least two RPC endpoints. The light client protocol performs several state validations and, in particular, compares the state provided by different RPC endpoints, looking for inconsistencies.\n\nThe `State` object contains, among other fields, a `Validators` field which stores the current validator set. A validator set is a list of validator addresses, public keys and associated voting powers, one per validator. It also stores, for historical reasons, the state of the proposer selection algorithm, in the form of the `ProposerPriority` field associated with each `Validator`.\n\nWhile the light client is able to validate the `ValidatorSet` retrieved from RPC endpoints, this validation does not include the `ProposerPriority` field associated with each `Validator`. As a result, when state sync adopts RPC endpoints that, for unknown reasons, provide an invalid state of the proposer selection algorithm, the node will not be able to properly run the consensus protocol, as their local view of which validator is the proposer of a given round and height will disagree with the views of the correct validators. If an increasing number of validators state sync using RPC endpoints with invalid states, the network eventually halts.\n\n### Patches\n\nRelease versions 0.34.34, 0.37.11, and 0.38.12 include a patch to address this issue.\n\nIn the patched versions, the light client protocol compares the `ProposerPriority` fields of the `ValidatorSet` instances retrieved from the RPC endpoints configured for state sync. If they differ, the computed `State` object is considered invalid and state sync will fail with an error.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue is observed when validators run state sync using RPC nodes that are malicious or report invalid states for the proposer selection algorithm.\n\nIt is worth noting that non-malicious nodes running upstream software should never report an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm. This situation may result from the adoption of nodes with customized code or which had their state, stored in local databases, manually updated.\n\nWhen the network public's RPC endpoints have an invalid state for the proposer election algorithm, there, new validators should refrain from using state sync for bootstrapping or be sure that they configure for state sync RPC endpoints with a valid state of the proposer election algorithm.\n\nA validator with an invalid state for the proposer selection algorithm will reject most of the proposed blocks and will have the network rejecting blocks it has proposed.  It is also possible to manually compare the state of the proposer election algorithm of nodes by comparing the outputs of the `/validators?height=_`  RPC endpoints. The outputs must fully match, including the ProposerPriority field associated with each validator. \n\n\n### References\n\n* [State Sync documentation](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/core/state-sync)\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on 12/08/24.

It is advised that chains consider their specific needs for their use case when setting the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` consensus parameter. Chains are encouraged to evaluate the impact of having proposed blocks with the maximum allowed block size, especially on bandwidth usage and block latency. Additionally, the `timeout_propose` parameter should be computed using the maximum allowed block size as a reference. This issue does not represent an actively exploitable vulnerability that would result in a direct loss of funds, however it may have a slight impact on block latency depending on a network’s topography.\n\nWhen setting a large `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, there are two main implications:\n* Increased bandwidth to propagate a block\n* Increased latency to propagate a block\n\nWhen combined, this may result in less round participation, and in some cases additional rounds may be required to meet the consensus threshold, which could lead to timeouts depending on the topography of a network and environmental factors. These factors can include the number of validators on a network, geographic distribution, network connectivity (including latency, bandwidth, and reachability), the functionality of the modules implementing the logic for a transaction in your chain, etc.  The cost to propagate a 21MB block, the default value for `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, will be far higher than the cost of propagating a smaller 1MB block. CometBFT recommends tuning this parameter to a smaller limit if full initial-round participation is an important quality for your chain.\n\n# Considerations\nCometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. A high-performing validator may find it necessary to experiment with tuning local configuration, optimizing network and compute resources, and implementing controls to inhibit spam.\n\n\n# Next Steps for Chains and Validators\n\nTo increase awareness of the potential impacts of this default parameter, the CometBFT team has updated the documentation (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1405, [v0.34.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.34/spec/abci/apps#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.37.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.38.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes)) for builders and maintainers of chain applications. Additionally, it is recommended that:\n\n\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers set a `BlockParams.MaxBytes` configuration appropriate for their use case at the application level; in some cases, fine-tuning `BlockParams` may require a network upgrade.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers evaluate how gas is used and required on their chain, including gas and fee parameters, no-fee or fee-exempt message policies, and ensure that any custom modules integrate with the gas and fee frameworks. This is especially important for chains that may have implemented custom modules or functionality to allow IBC messages to bypass fees.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers audit all of their currently-set parameters and configurations to ensure that they are appropriate for their use case.\n\n* All validators develop and implement anti-spam measures on their nodes. Amulet encourages validators to form working groups to collaborate on spam prevention and on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n* All validators consider developing and implementing tooling that would allow them to sample incoming transactions to enable them to fine-tune the level of service they would like to provide to be resilient in slowdown scenarios. Amulet also encourages validators to collaborate on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n\n\nThe CometBFT team has also revisited all the checks performed by the consensus protocol regarding proposed blocks. This investigation has confirmed that proposed blocks with size exceeding the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` limit established by the application are not accepted by nodes. The team notwithstanding has decided to introduce additional sanity checks for the size of proposed blocks (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1408), allowing for an early identification and rejection of invalid or oversized blocks. These code changes will be included in the _next_ release of each branch of CometBFT.\n\nAs more chains adopt the Interchain Stack for new and cutting-edge use cases, the CometBFT team recommends that all chains regularly evaluate their parameters and configurations to ensure they meet the needs of their ecosystem as their networks mature. \n\n\nFor more information about CometBFT, see [https://docs.cometbft.com](https://docs.cometbft.com/). \n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue was reported via the vulnerability disclosure channel at [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io) on Friday, September 23, 2023.

To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/"}, {"id": "GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk to 0.50.13, 0.47.17", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk: Cosmos SDK: x/group can halt when erroring in EndBlocker", "ruleId": "trivy-GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/integration-tests/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "high", "references": ["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk", "https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/commit/cbd69fb1f4fac418c1f8c6253f5f91fb1263776a", "https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg"], "description": "Name: ISA-2025-002: x/group can halt when erroring in EndBlocker\nComponent: CosmosSDK\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected versions: <= v0.47.16, <= 0.50.12\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes, Users on chains that utilize the groups module\nCosmos SDK chains in unpatched releases that use the `x/group` module are affected.\n\n### Description\n\nAn issue was discovered in the groups module where malicious proposals would result in an errors triggered in the module's end blocker that could result in a chain halt.

All versions of the `x/crisis` module are affected on all versions of the Cosmos SDK.\n\n### Details\nThe `x/crisis` module is supposed to allow anyone to halt a chain in the event of a violated invariant by sending a `MsgVerifyInvariant` with the name of the invariant. Processing this message takes extra processing power hence a `ConstantFee` was introduced on the chain that is charged as extra from the reporter for the extra computational work. This is supposed to avert spammers on the chain making nodes do extra computations using this transaction. By not charging the `ConstantFee`, the transactions related to invariant checking are relatively cheaper compared to the computational need and other transactions.\n\nThat said, the submitter still has to pay the transaction fee to put the transaction on the network, hence using this weakness for spamming is limited by the usual mechanisms.\n\nSynthetic testing showed up to a 20% increase in CPU usage on a validator node that is spammed by hundreds of `MsgVerifyInvariant` messages which still makes this an expensive operation to carry out on a live blockchain network.\n\n### Patches\nThe `ConstantFee` charge of the `x/crisis` module will either be fixed or disabled in an upcoming regular release of the Cosmos SDK.\n\nThe `x/crisis` module was originally intended to allow chains to halt rather than continue with some unknown behavior in the case of an invariant violation (safety over liveness). However, as chains mature, and especially as the potential [cost of halting increases](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/570), chains should consider carefully what invariants they really want to halt for, and what invariants are just sort of helpful sanity checks.\n\nThe SDK team is working on new modules that allow chain developers to fine-tune the chain invariants and the necessary actions.\n\nHence, the decision was made that the `x/crisis` module will be deprecated when new modules take over its responsibilities.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround posted. Validators are advised to leave some extra computing room on their servers for possible spamming scenarios. (This is a good measure in any case.)\n\n### References\nSDK developer epic about invariant checking: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/15706\n"}, {"id": "GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v7 to 7.10.0", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v7: IBC-Go: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in a chain halt", "ruleId": "trivy-GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/integration-tests/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "critical", "references": ["https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go", "https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.10.0", "https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.7.0"], "description": "Name: ISA-2025-001: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in a chain halt\nComponent: IBC-Go\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected versions: IBC-Go >= v7; Earlier IBC-Go versions MAY also be affected.\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes, IBC Middleware authors\n\n### Description\n\nAn issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain.

Probably not but it depends on your transfer middlewares\n\nThis patch is not state breaking unless you depend on transfer middlewares that deserialize and serialize acknowledgement packets before passing them to the transfer handler.  As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch. So if these are the only transfer middlewares you depend on, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).\n\n#### What to do if you do depend on ack-serializing middleware\n\nIn the unlikely case that you depend on middlewares that serialize ack packets and you do not update them when you apply this patch, all transfers that are handled by the middleware will fail (or experience other unexpected behavior) if the serialization approach differs from the transfer app's. If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.\n\nTo update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: `transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON`, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:\n\n```\nimport transfertypes \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types\"\ntransfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON\nfunc MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {\n\treturn transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&ack)\n}\n```\nWhen you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade. So for absolute clarity: chains with these ack-serializing middlewares must do coordinated upgrades\n\n#### Why we retracted the earlier patch in favor of this approach\nWe retracted the releases of ibc-go we cut earlier today because these broke all transfer middlewares that deserialized then re-serialized receive packets differently than the transfer app. It turned out that this was a common pattern (unlike serializing/deserializing ack packets), so widely used middlewares, including packet-forward-middleware, broke unexpectedly.\n\nIn the new set of patches, we removed this constraint on how middlewares serialize receive packets, preventing this breakage. Only the serialization requirement on acknowledgement packets remains. This is convenient because this is the only constraint we had to add to fix the vulnerability, and middlewares that deserialize and serialize ack packets are much less common than ones that do so for receive packets. The constraint on receive packets was added for defense in depth.\n\n#### Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release\n* In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:\n* Tested pfm v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Ran a patched node on mainnet on the cosmos hub and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM\n* Ran a patched node on osmosis and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks\nThis is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* February 18, 2025, 4:54am PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* February 18, 2025, 6:56am PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* February 18, 2025, 8:15am PST: Core team completes validation of issue\n* February 25, 2025, 8:00am PST / 17:00 CET: Pre-notification delivered\n* February 27, 2025, 8:00am PST / 17:00 CET: Patch made available\n* February 27, 2025, 1:00pm PST: Patch re-release made available\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by swelf19 on HackerOne on February 18, 2025.

To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments running directly on affected hardware. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/"}, {"id": "CVE-2025-54410", "fix": {"template": "Update github.com/docker/docker to 28.0.0", "available": true}, "title": "github.com/docker/docker: github.com/moby/moby: Moby's Firewalld reload removes bridge network isolation", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2025-54410", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "dai-plus-plus/challenge/project/lib/chainlink/integration-tests/go.mod", "line": 0}, "severity": "low", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-54410", "https://firewalld.org/documentation/howto/reload-firewalld.html", "https://github.com/moby/moby"], "description": "Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products.

If this error is encountered, the program should handshake again to start with a fresh `CipherState`.\n\n### Issue 2: Potential denial of service via invalid ciphertext\n\nIf an attacker sends an invalid ciphertext into one peer's `Decrypt`, the nonce is incremented unconditionally. This causes a desync of the `CipherState` due to a nonce mismatch between the peers, resulting in a failure to decrypt all subsequent messages. A new handshake will be required to establish a new `CipherState`.\n\nThis has been resolved in the patched version by returning authentication errors from `Decrypt` before incrementing the nonce. \n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in https://github.com/flynn/noise/pull/44, tagged as v1.0.0.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThese issues were discovered during [an audit](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/cure53-turbotunnel-2021.pdf) of a user of this package ([dnstt](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/)).

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be.

If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience).

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field.

However, a recent addition to Miri checks that references passed to functions are valid during the entire execution of the function, even when those references are passed inside a struct. This poses an issue for dropping self-referencing values, as the reference becomes invalid during the dropping process. Effectively, since self-referencing structs are not allowed in vanilla Rust, there is no allowance for dropping data during a function that has also been given a reference to that data. There's usually no way to pass a and &a to the same function.\n\nA fix was attempted, where the struct would be turned in to a raw byte array and only transformed back into the underlying data type inside each function. This is allowable as a reference can be created and die over the body of a function, as long as the reference was created inside the function. However, this is also not sound if the original struct contains padding. There is no way to initialize padding bytes to a known value that Miri will accept, so when it is cast to an array some of the bytes contain uninitialized values. This is not acceptable (despite the fact that these bytes are never read) due to the potential for optimizations that may read from the uninitialized bytes. Besides which, this fix does not allow for template or constant parameters as there is no way to check the size of a templated type without giving specific, concrete values for the template parameters.\n\nThe final solution was to use this fix while wrapping the raw byte array in MaybeUninit<>."}, {"id": "CVE-2025-4432", "fix": {"template": "Update ring to 0.17.13", "available": true}, "title": "ring: ring: Some AES functions may panic when overflow checking is enabled in ring", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2025-4432", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "jotterp/challenge/framework/Cargo.lock", "line": 0}, "severity": "medium", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-4432", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2350655", "https://github.com/briansmith/ring"], "description": "A flaw was found in Rust's Ring package.
