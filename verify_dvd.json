The recent news about the aCropalypse bug also highlights that more subtle bugs like blind spots in file formats can lead to serious implications. Sometimes the specifications are at fault and sometimes the implementations.\n\nIn the case of the Ethereum ABI, I have to blame the specification more than the vulnerable implementations. The specification allows zero-sized-types (ZST), which can cause denial-of-service upon parsing a malicious payload and schema. If a ZST takes zero bytes when stored on disk, but after parsing occupies memory, then there is the possibility for a denial of service.\n\nFor instance, what will happen if a parser expects an array of ZST? It will try to parse as many ZST as the byte array claims to contain. The following figure first shows a payload of 20 bytes which will deserialize to an array of the numbers 2, 1, 3. The second payload will deserialize to 232 elements of a ZST like an empty tuple or empty array. \n\n20 bytes of data:\n```\nlength=0x3u64 2u32 1u32 3u32\n```\n8 bytes of data\n```\nlength=0xFFFFFFFu64\n```\n\nNow, this is not a problem if the individual elements take zero memory after parsing. Though, a common flaw is at least during serialization a large amount of memory will be required. If this case is not handled explicitly in the implementation then we are facing a DoS vector. For example, an implementation could decide to represent an array of ZST differently than a normal array and parse it in constant time, instead of looping and naively adding elements to an in-memory array.\n\nI mentioned that I believe this is a flaw in the specification. The reason for this is that the Ethereum ABI could have decided to disallow ZST completely. Actually, it turned out that in the latest versions of Solidity and Vyper it is not possible to define ZST like empty tuples or empty arrays. Even though the languages do not allow it, it is still allowed in the ABI specification.\n\n## POC\n\nWe define the data payload as `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFF`. It consists of two 32-byte blocks, which describe a serialized array of ZST. The first block defines an offset to the array’s elements. The second block defines the length of the array. Independent of the programming language we will reference it always as payload.\n\nWe will try to decode this payload using the ABI schemata ()[] and uint32[0][]. The former represents a dynamic array of empty tuples and the latter a dynamic array of empty static arrays. The distinction between dynamic and static is important here, because an empty static array takes zero bytes, whereas a dynamic one takes a few bytes because it serializes the length of the array.\n\nThe following Python program uses the official eth_abi library and will hang and eventually cause an out-of-memory error.\n\n    from eth_abi import decode\n    data = bytearray.fromhex(payload)\n    decode(['()[]'], data)\n\n## SUGGESTED REMEDIATION\n\nWe suggest to disallow the parsing of ZST.\n"}, {"id": "CVE-2024-3651", "fix": {"template": "Update idna to 3.7", "available": true}, "title": "idna: python-idna: potential DoS via resource consumption via specially crafted inputs to idna.encode()", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2024-3651", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "lib/multicall/examples/python/requirements.txt", "line": 0}, "severity": "medium", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3846", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3651", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/2274779"], "description": "A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6.

Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations."}, {"id": "CVE-2025-50181", "fix": {"template": "Update urllib3 to 2.5.0", "available": true}, "title": "urllib3: urllib3: urllib3 redirects are not disabled when retries are disabled on PoolManager instantiation", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2025-50181", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "lib/multicall/examples/python/requirements.txt", "line": 0}, "severity": "medium", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-50181", "https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3", "https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/f05b1329126d5be6de501f9d1e3e36738bc08857"], "description": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python.

When using `rustix::fs::Dir` using the `linux_raw` backend, it's possible for the iterator to \"get stuck\" when an IO error is encountered. Combined with a memory over-allocation issue in `rustix::fs::Dir::read_more`, this can cause quick and unbounded memory explosion (gigabytes in a few seconds if used on a hot path) and eventually lead to an OOM crash of the application. The symptoms were initially discovered in https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/issues/284. That post has lots of details of our investigation. Full details can be read on the GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm repo advisory. If a program tries to access a directory with its file descriptor after the file has been unlinked (or any other action that leaves the `Dir` iterator in the stuck state), and the implementation does not break after seeing an error, it can cause a memory explosion. As an example, Linux's various virtual file systems (e.g. `/proc`, `/sys`) can contain directories that spontaneously pop in and out of existence. Attempting to iterate over them using `rustix::fs::Dir` directly or indirectly (e.g. with the `procfs` crate) can trigger this fault condition if the implementation decides to continue on errors. An attacker knowledgeable about the implementation details of a vulnerable target can therefore try to trigger this fault condition via any one or a combination of several available APIs. If successful, the application host will quickly run out of memory, after which the application will likely be terminated by an OOM killer, leading to denial of service.

false\nKeys equivalent? true\nOrig key: f1ce0e4395592f4de24f6423099e022925ad5d2d7039b614aaffdbb194a0d189\nRestored: 01ce0e4395592f4de24f6423099e0227ec9cb921e3b7858581ec0d26223966a6\n```\n`restored` is equal to `orig` mod `N`.\n\n### Impact\n\nFull private key extraction when signing a single malicious message (that passes `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`)"}, {"id": "CVE-2024-42459", "fix": {"template": "Update elliptic to 6.5.7", "available": true}, "title": "elliptic: elliptic: nodejs/elliptic: EDDSA signature malleability due to missing signature length check", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2024-42459", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "lib/murky/differential_testing/scripts/package-lock.json", "line": 0}, "severity": "low", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-42459", "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic", "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/commit/accb61e9c1a005e5c8ff96a8b33893100bb42d11"], "description": "In the Elliptic package 6.5.6 for Node.js, EDDSA signature malleability occurs because there is a missing signature length check, and thus zero-valued bytes can be removed or appended."}, {"id": "CVE-2024-42460", "fix": {"template": "Update elliptic to 6.5.7", "available": true}, "title": "elliptic: elliptic: nodejs/elliptic: ECDSA signature malleability due to missing checks", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2024-42460", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "lib/murky/differential_testing/scripts/package-lock.json", "line": 0}, "severity": "low", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-42460", "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic", "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/commit/accb61e9c1a005e5c8ff96a8b33893100bb42d11"], "description": "In the Elliptic package 6.5.6 for Node.js, ECDSA signature malleability occurs because there is a missing check for whether the leading bit of r and s is zero."}, {"id": "CVE-2024-42461", "fix": {"template": "Update elliptic to 6.5.7", "available": true}, "title": "elliptic: elliptic: nodejs/elliptic: ECDSA implementation malleability due to BER-enconded signatures being allowed", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2024-42461", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "lib/murky/differential_testing/scripts/package-lock.json", "line": 0}, "severity": "low", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-42461", "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic", "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/commit/accb61e9c1a005e5c8ff96a8b33893100bb42d11"], "description": "In the Elliptic package 6.5.6 for Node.js, ECDSA signature malleability occurs because BER-encoded signatures are allowed."}, {"id": "CVE-2024-48948", "fix": {"template": "Update elliptic to 6.6.0", "available": true}, "title": "elliptic: elliptic: ECDSA signature verification error may reject legitimate transactions", "ruleId": "trivy-CVE-2024-48948", "category": "dependencies", "location": {"file": "lib/murky/differential_testing/scripts/package-lock.json", "line": 0}, "severity": "low", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-48948", "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/11/18/we-found-cryptography-bugs-in-the-elliptic-library-using-wycheproof", "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/11/18/we-found-cryptography-bugs-in-the-elliptic-library-using-wycheproof/"], "description": "The Elliptic package 6.5.7 for Node.js, in its for ECDSA implementation, does not correctly verify valid signatures if the hash contains at least four leading 0 bytes and when the order of the elliptic curve's base point is smaller than the hash, because of an _truncateToN anomaly.
